In recent years, 9increasing interest is geared on the use of specially designed electrospun nano ﬁbers 10 for water/wastewater treatment applications. The nano ﬁbers can be used in the form 11 of nonwoven structures, as stand-alone membranes, as support layer or as a surface 12 modiﬁcation layer that enables added functionality to a composite material. 13 Continuous research has been carried out in optimizing the nano ﬁber membrane 14 design and structure by manipulating material, process and surrounding parameters 15 in the electrospinning process. This chapter highlights the recent advances and 16 developments on the potential and application of electrospun nano ﬁbers for water/ 17 wastewater treatment.

The 30 ease of fabrication and functionalization makes it more promising. The nano ﬁbers 31 have also attracted many research activities on their preparation, modi ﬁcation, and 32 treatment capabilities for water and wastewater treatment processes. This is pri- 33 marily attributed to the ﬁlter-like characteristics of nano ﬁber mats, which are similar 34 to the ﬁlters used in the water/wastewater treatment ﬁeld. Nano ﬁbers as membranes 35 take a center role in this review as most nano ﬁbers reported in literature are pre- 36 pared in this structure/form. However, nano ﬁbers have also been used as electrodes 37 or adsorbent materials for other processes. 38 Membrane technology plays a signi ﬁcant role in ensuring water security around 39 the world (Shannon et al. 2008 ). This is because of its high ef ﬁciency, 40 cost-effectiveness, and high performance in treating different types of water sources 41 towards the desired water quality. Among the most common membrane separation 42 processes include reverse osmosis, micro ﬁltration, ultra ﬁltration, and nano ﬁltration. 43 Polymeric membranes are the most widely available in the market but still face a 44 number of challenges in terms of fouling, degradation, and their overall stability (Le 45 and Nunes 2016 ). Hence, there is a surge of research done on improving the 46 polymeric membrane performance by manipulating their design, structure, and 47 physiochemical properties. Most commonly, these membranes are in the form of 48ﬂat sheet and hollow ﬁber structures. In recent years, the use of nanotechnology and 49 nanomaterials has considerably improved the development of membranes and 50 especially on the use of electrospun nano ﬁbers (Goh et al. 2016 ). 51 In the past two decades, research on nano ﬁbers as materials for water and 52 wastewater treatment (membranes, electrodes, adsorbents, etc.) has surged dra- 53 matically with many works done on the nano ﬁber synthesis, surface modi ﬁcation, 54 nanomaterial incorporation, mechanical and thermal stability improvement, etc. 55 This chapter reviews the recent advances on the developments of nano ﬁbers and 56 their application to water and wastewater treatment. 5720.2 Electrospun Nano ﬁbers: Fabrication, Design, 58 and Properties 5920.2.1 Introduction to Electrospinning and Nano ﬁbers 60 Nano ﬁbers loosely refer to ﬁbers having diameters less than 1 µm, and have been 61 gaining wide interests in many applications due to their exciting properties and 62 functionalities (Bhardwaj and Kundu 2010 ). There are a number of ways to fab- 63 ricate nano ﬁbers such as template synthesis, melt blowing, self-assembly, nano- 64 lithography, and electrospinning. For membrane fabrication especially, 65 electrospinning is the most facile and effective way of producing nano ﬁber432 L. D.

The recent advances on upscaling and mass production 68 capability of electrospinning have greatly increased its potential use and promise for 69 future development of functional materials and membranes (Luana et al. 2013 ). 70 Simply, electrospinning uses a high-voltage electric ﬁeld to force a polymer 71 solution to jet out from a small nozzle opening and elongate while whipping 72 instantaneously towards a grounded collector where it is collected and form a 73 nonwoven ﬂat sheet membrane structure. Figure 20.1 shows a schematic of the 74 electrospinning system. The process itself is simple, yet the optimization of the 75 different parameters such as the material, process, and posttreatment parameters can 76 be challenging, when designing a speci ﬁc structure and property of the nano ﬁber 77 membrane. The most common material used for electrospinning is polymer-based 78 materials, with more than 200 of such polymers have been made into different 79 nanoﬁber structures. Several papers have summarized the various strategies in 80 nanoﬁber membrane fabrication and modi ﬁcation in recent years including the 81 effect of process/operating parameters, material selection and preparation, and 82 posttreatment conditions (Ahmed et al. 2015 ; Teo and Ramakrishna 2006 ; Tijing 83 et al. 2014a ). Nano ﬁber membranes can be divided into three main designs: (1) neat 84 nanoﬁber membranes, (2) composite nano ﬁber membranes, and (3) surface- 85 modiﬁed/functionalized nano ﬁber membranes. 86 The use of nano ﬁber membranes for water and wastewater treatment applica- 87 tions has attracted wide interest in the last 20 years. This is primarily because of the 88 versatility of the nano ﬁber formation, where the porosity, pore size, structure, 89 surface properties, and mechanical and thermal stability can be controlled Fig. 20.1 Schematic of electrospinning system showing the three main components: high voltage power supply, syringe containing polymer solution, and grounded collector.

Page 4,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF90 (Tijing et al. 2016 ). Depending on the desired properties, nano ﬁber membranes can 91 be made into hydrophilic, hydrophobic, omniphobic, highly porous, as support 92 material, as self-standing membrane, as antibacterial or antifoulling membrane, as 93 self-heating membrane, as adsorbent, and many other properties. This chapter 94 reveals the attractive properties and applications of such nano ﬁber membranes 95 mainly for water and wastewater treatment processes. 9620.2.2 Electrospinning Parameters 97 Electrospinning is a facile technique in producing nonwoven nano ﬁbers mats or 98 membranes. Though the concept and method are quite simple, producing nano ﬁbers 99 with the desired properties and design could be tricky (Tijing et al. 2014a ). The 100 material selection and preparation are essential parameters for the resulting nano- 101 ﬁbers. The polymer concentration of the solution has a strong effect on the ﬁber 102 size, the presence of beads, and the electrospinnability of the solution. Con ﬂicting 103 studies have been reported in the literature about the effect of polymer concentration 104 onﬁber size, but majority of the reports indicated that high polymer concentration 105 results in bigger ﬁbers, while low polymer concentration produces smaller ﬁbers 106 (Ki et al. 2005 ). In addition, below a certain threshold polymer concentration 107 (which varies depending on the type of polymer used), there will be higher ten- 108 dency for sputtering which results in the production of beads-on-string ﬁber for- 109 mation. Beads on nano ﬁbers are usually regarded as defects as they can serve as 110 stress points for any external load towards the nano ﬁber, which consequently affects 111 its overall mechanical properties. However, in some studies, the beads could be a 112 desired design, which adds more roughness and increases surface hydrophobicity 113 (Tijing et al. 2016 ). The polymer concentration is closely related to the solution 114 viscosity. At higher polymer concentration, solution viscosity in most cases also 115 increases. Thus, it was observed that higher concentration (therefore more viscous) 116 has more chances of clogging in the electrospinning nozzle and eventually block it. 117 Thus, ﬁber formation is inhibited. Nevertheless, the less viscous solution is also not 118 desired because it could lead to sputtering effect. So that a certain viscosity for a 119 speciﬁc polymer solution is required for smooth ﬁber formation. Another solution 120 parameter that is very much related with concentration and viscosity is the polymer 121 molecular weight. Generally, there is a minimum molecular weight for a speci ﬁc 122 polymer for it to have good electrospinnability (Tao and Shivkumar 2007 ; Haghi 123 and Akbari 2007 ). Hence, the importance of optimizing the solution parameters is 124 essential to fabricate smooth, cylindrical, and uniform nano ﬁber mat. 125 For jet formation to proceed, the solution must be conductive enough to improve 126 its charge carrying capability so that the applied electric ﬁeld can promote the 127 repulsion of charges in the jet that stretches and elongates the polymer until it is 128 collected (Talwar et al. 2010 ). Polymers innately have charges themselves, thus 129 nanoﬁber formation is possible. However, the kind of solvent and additives used 130 greatly enhances the conductivity of the solution which also helps in the434 L. D.

Page 5,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF131 electrospinnablity of the solution (Kim et al. 2005 ). Studies have shown that adding 132 salts in the polymer solution increases conductivity thereby increasing the chances 133 of further elongation resulting in thinner ﬁbers. The presence of additives also 134 promotes the formation of nanonets due to charge attraction from neighboring 135 particles (Barakat et al. 2009 ). 136 In as much as the material selection and preparation are important factors, the 137 process conditions also dictate much of the resulting nano ﬁber design and prop- 138 erties. The applied electric ﬁeld is a requirement for nano ﬁber formation. This is 139 basically dictated by the applied voltage (Sill and von Recum 2008 ) and the nozzle 140 tip-to-collector distance (TCD). At high applied voltage, the driving force that helps 141 overcome the surface tension of the solution to emit thin ﬁbers is much greater, 142 hence expecting more charge repulsion resulting in thinner nano ﬁber formation. 143 However, one must be careful not to increase too much of the voltage as this could 144 also lead to sputtering as the driving force is too high that there is sudden breakage 145 of polymer entanglement at the nozzle tip leading to sputtering. Depending on the 146 polymer used, the applied voltage is usually in the range of 5 –40 kV. There is 147 always a threshold voltage for speci ﬁc kind of material and its solution properties. 148 As mentioned above, the tip-to-collector distance is also important. At a longer 149 TCD, once the polymer solution is emitted from the nozzle, the longer ﬂight time 150 towards the collector gives higher chance for the solvent to evaporate, thus leading 151 to thinner nano ﬁber formation (Matabola and Moutloali 2013 ). On the other hand, 152 too short of TCD would likely result in ﬁlm formation instead of ﬁbers, as the short 153 ﬂight time is not enough for the solvent to evaporate in air. For most electrospin- 154 ning setup, optimizing the TCD together with other parameters is essential. Usually, 155 a TCD between 15 and 25 cm is used in many studies. As nano ﬁbers are emitted 156 from the nozzle via applied electric ﬁeld as driving force, the amount of solution 157 that actually is exposed to the nozzle tip is controlled by the solution feed rate. In 158 most cases, a syringe pump is used to push the solution, and the feed rate is usually 159 1 ml/h or lower. This is to ensure that there is suf ﬁcient amount of solution going to 160 the nozzle, ideally in the same rate of the ﬁber emission from the nozzle (Matabola 161 and Moutloali 2013 ). If the solution feed rate is too slow, this usually leads to 162 uneven and nonuniform ﬁber formation as not enough solution is being emitted. On 163 the other hand, too fast feed rate also leads to beaded ﬁbers as the supply of solution 164 at the nozzle tip is over accumulated. This produces beaded structures, garland, or 165 even ribbon-like ﬁber formation, as observed by other studies. Hence, it is neces- 166 sary that a suitable feed rate is used for electrospinning. 167 Other factors to consider for electrospinning of nano ﬁbers are its ambient con- 168 dition—especially temperature and relative humidity, and the way it is processed 169 post-fabrication. The surrounding humidity during electrospinning is found to have 170 an important effect on the nano ﬁber morphology and structure (De Vrieze et al. 171 2008 ). At low humidity, i.e., less moisture in air, there is bigger tendency for rapid 172 evaporation of solvents to the air as the air has higher capacity to hold moisture. 173 This usually results in thinner nano ﬁber formation. On the other hand, high 174 humidity can produce pores on the nano ﬁber as the moisture in the air can condense 175 on the formed nano ﬁber. However, if the polymer used is water soluble, high20 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 435Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 435/468",968
Page 6,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF 176 humidity could potentially produce thinner ﬁbers as the moisture in the air helps in 177 further dis solution of the ﬁber while it is on ﬂight to the collector. The temperature 178 of the environment also has similar effect. Higher temperature (which also could 179 mean drier surrounding) could lead to less viscous solution hence promoting thinner 180 ﬁbers. The post-fabrication treatment methods help in improving the overall 181 mechanical, and morphological properties of the nano ﬁber membranes. Hot-press 182 treatment in particular, which presses the nano ﬁber between two hot plates or just 183 exposed to high temperature in an oven, promotes controlled melting of some 184 nanoﬁber nodes that leads to node fusion thereby increasing the overall mechanical 185 properties. However, this method also reduces the overall pore size and porosity 186 due to the fusion occurrence (De Vrieze et al. 2008 ). Table 20.1 summarizes the 187 effect of various electrospinning parameters on the nano ﬁber formation, structure, 188 and morphology. 189 As a guide, smooth nano ﬁber formation with uniform ﬁber sizes is always the 190 ideal structure desired for nano ﬁbers. This can be controlled by manipulating 191 various parameters before, during, and after electrospinning process. The proper 192 optimization of these many parameters for any speci ﬁc polymer used is necessary to 193 achieve the desired nano ﬁber morphology and properties. 19420.2.3 Electrospun Nano ﬁber Design and Properties 195 The versatility of electrospinning to produce nano ﬁbers is one of its most attractive 196 features for many applications. Nano ﬁbers can be designed and prepared in many 197 conﬁgurations, structures, and functionalities in a more facile way compared to 198 other material preparation processes.

The pore size distribution is 201 usually a little wide unless posttreatment processes are done to the nano ﬁber mat. 202 The nano ﬁbers are formed in an overlapping manner, hence the overall structure is 203 full of voids and less torturous. There is an interconnection of the pores from the 204 surface down to the bottom of the mat. Thus, this kind of structure found its 205 application in water treatment application as ﬁltration membrane. As nano ﬁbers are 206 overlapping, they form surface nano-micro roughness that affects the wettability of 207 the material. If a hydrophobic polymer is used for electrospinning, the resulting 208 nanoﬁber mat has more pronounced hydrophobicity due to the added roughness. In 209 a similar way, when hydrophilic polymer is used, it becomes more hydrophilic. For 210 most cases, neat or as-spun nano ﬁbers lack some of the desired surface properties 211 for speci ﬁc applications. Hence, many works have been done on fabricating 212 nanocomposite mats or membranes (Huang et al. 2003 ; Tijing et al. 2012a ,2014a ). 213 Figure 20.2 shows various nano ﬁber structures and designs that can be fabricated 214 by electrospinning. 215 Nanocomposite mats or membranes based on nano ﬁbers can be manufactured 216 via direct blending of component materials (usually nanoparticles or nano ﬁllers 217 mixed with polymer solution), by in situ growth of nanoparticles, or by the post- 218 treatment decoration of nanomaterials. The direct blending method can change the 219 morphology of the nano ﬁbers as the ﬁller element changes the rheological prop- 220 erties of the solution, and at the same time adds new functionalities to the resulting (a) (b) (c) (f) (e) (d) Fig. 20.2 Different nano ﬁber structures and morphologies that can be fabricated using electrospinning by manipulating electrospinning parameters, nozzle design and collector conﬁguration: aconventional randomly oriented nano ﬁbers (reprinted with permission from Xue et al. 2017 ),binternally porous nano ﬁbers (Jingwei et al. 2008 ),caligned nano ﬁbers (reprinted with permission from Li et al. 2003 ),dhollow nano ﬁbers (reprinted with permission from Li and Xia 2004 ),enanonet formation within spaces between nano ﬁbers (Wang et al. 2011 ), fAg nanoparticle with hydrophobic coating, surface-modi ﬁed nano ﬁber (Liao et al. 2013 )20 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 437Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 437/468",697
Page 8,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF221 nanocomposite. This strategy has been investigated in many research studies with 222 inorganic nanoparticles as nano ﬁllers such as TiO 2, SiO 2, carbon nanotubes, gra- 223 phene, Ag, Au, etc. The inherent properties of these nano ﬁllers provide new 224 functionalities to the nano ﬁbers especially when located on the nano ﬁber surface. 225 The main challenge for this method is the proper dispersion of these nanoparticles 226 in the polymer solution. To address this dispersion challenge, other researchers 227 impart functionality to the nano ﬁbers by in situ growth of nanoparticles in/on the 228 nanoﬁbers. For example, AgNO 3as a precursor to Ag nanoparticles has been 229 blended in the polymer solution in liquid form, and then after electrospinning, the 230 mat is exposed to UV light to promote the growth of Ag nanoparticles (Tijing et al. 231 2012b ). This gives Ag more bonding with the polymer matrix thereby lowering the 232 chances of release. However, both of the mentioned approaches (blending or in situ 233 decoration) can oftentimes lead to nanoparticles being embedded inside the polymer 234 matrix, which may enhance the overall mechanical properties, but the added 235 functionality of the nanoparticles may not be as effective as they are not directly 236 exposed on the surface. With this in mind, several groups attempted to functionalize 237 nanoﬁbers by surface modi ﬁcation techniques. This involves adding some func- 238 tional groups on the nano ﬁber surface via dipping, spraying, layer-by-layer depo- 239 sition, and other methods as anchors for the succeeding immobilization of 240 nanoparticles (Liao et al. 2013 ; Formo et al. 2008 ). This method ensures that 241 nanoparticles are located on the surface of the nano ﬁbers, rather than inside the 242 polymer matrix. Many of the results showed interesting properties such as added 243 omniphobicity, hydrophibicity, hydrophilicity, antibacterial, self-heating, and other 244 desirable functional qualities. The main drawback of this technique though is the 245 need for really strong bonding of the nanoparticle on the surface, otherwise, they 246 will be easily released and can act as secondary pollutant. 247 Another way of ensuring that nanoparticles are attached on the surface is via the 248 use of coaxial electrospinning technique (Ma et al. 2012 ). Here, instead of using 249 only a single nozzle, two concentric nozzles are used wherein the inner nozzle 250 (core) is used as the main polymer carrier or host, while the outer nozzle (shell) is 251 provided with functional materials designed to be attached on the surface of the 252 nanoﬁbers. By simultaneously electrospinning these two solutions, one-step 253 nanoparticle-decorated nano-micro ﬁbers can be made. Though this is very 254 promising, there is dif ﬁculty in ensuring proper encapsulation of the core nano ﬁbers 255 with shell nano ﬁbers as the two solutions may differ in properties which behave 256 differently at speci ﬁed applied voltage. Not only is this technique used for 257 nanoparticle decoration, it can also be utilized to make core –shell structure of two 258 different polymers if the design of such is necessary. 259 In nano ﬁber electrospinning, the ﬁber size is in the range of 100 –1000 nm, thus 260 theﬁbers are not really in the true nano range. A new design in the electrospinning 261 research is towards the formation of true nano ﬁbers or commonly called as nanonets, 262 with a ﬁber diameter range of 50 –80 nm. The nanonets are also known as spider web 263 or spider net form. These nanonets are formed via phase separation splitting due to 264 exposure to high electric ﬁeld (Lian et al. 2013). Nevertheless, this design can be 265 controlled in its formation, providing much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio if all438 L. D.

Page 9,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF266 of the nano ﬁber mat is covered. However, there is dif ﬁculty in the full coverage of 267 nanonets of the macrosize of the nano ﬁber mat. This is an area of great interest for 268 future nano ﬁber-related work. If one is able to fully capitalize on the nanonet 269 formation, this could provide more reactive sites, and increased porosity overall that 270 might be interesting for ﬁltration applications. 271 Nano ﬁbers are formed normally in 2D structure, wherein the thickness is very 272 thin while width or length is quite large. However, making a 3D nano ﬁber structure 273 is very possible and is potentially useful as sorbent materials (Kim and Kim 2007 ; 274 Wu et al. 2014 ). One approach to do doing this is through long-time electrospinning 275 at the same area. As electrospinning progresses, the thickness of the nano ﬁbers 276 increases towards 3D structure. Another way is to electrospin several layers of 277 nanoﬁbers, and just stacking them together to make the 3D structure. The main 278 drawback of this is the robustness of such 3D mats as the individual stacked layer 279 may not adhere well with each other. However, recent studies carried a more 280 interesting approaching, by exposing the 2D nano ﬁber to chemical gas foaming 281 (Jiang et al. 2015 ), which expands the nano ﬁber matrix and produce low-density 282 sponge-like material. 283 New advances in nano ﬁber design are geared on producing intraporous structure, 284 i.e., having internal pores within each nano ﬁber. This can be selectively removing a 285 component from the formed ﬁber or by inducing polymer-solvent phase separation. 286 The provision of internal porous drastically increases the overall surface area of the 287 nanoﬁbers. Other new works are also on the fabrication of aligned nano ﬁbers (Wu 288 and Qin 2013 ), instead of nonwoven form. These aligned nano ﬁbers can be used as 289 electrode or for tissue engineering application. Alignment of nano ﬁbers is done by 290 using a rotating drum at high speed, or by manipulating the collector design (Kim 291 and Kim 2018 ; Kim et al. 2016 ). Another interesting structure is the hollow 292 nanoﬁber design, wherein the core part of the ﬁber is hollow (Li et al. 2005 ). This 293 type of design is best achieved using a coaxial or triaxial nozzle, whereby the core 294 layer is selectively dissolved by heat treatment or by some other methods. 295 Overall, nano ﬁbers present very promising potential for a variety of applications 296 especially in water and wastewater treatment. Membranes are now widely used in 297 many of these water/wastewater treatment applications, and the overall character- 298 istics and properties (high speci ﬁc surface area, high porosity, controllable pore 299 sizes, interpenetrated pore structure, adequate mechanical strength, easily func- 300 tionalized or surface-modi ﬁed, etc.) of nano ﬁber-based membranes are highly 301 desirable for ﬁltration applications. Depending on the process application, the 302 nanoﬁbers can be made into hydrophilic or hydrophobic structure, and can be 303 utilized as a stand-alone membrane, as a support layer, or a host polymer/carrier. 304 The nano ﬁber structure can also be interesting as an electrode material or as sorbent 305 material. The versatility of electrospun nano ﬁbers makes them one of the most 306 researched materials in the last two decades. Still, more research is needed to fully 307 utilize these nano ﬁbers towards commercial use in water/wastewater treatment.AQ220 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 439Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 439/468",898

MD is a hybrid 312 thermal/membrane separation process that works via phase change, and thus a 313 temperature difference is needed between the feed and cold sides (Tijing et al. 314 2014b ). It is one of the emerging technologies that can utilize low-grade heat as an 315 energy source. In usual cases, the feed side is at higher temperature normally around 316 40–80 °C and the cold side is maintained around room temperature ( *20 °C) 317 (Tijing et al. 2015 ). With the use of a hydrophobic membrane, the partial vapor 318 pressure difference between the two ﬂuids enables evaporation of the feed side, only 319 allowing water vapor to pass through the membrane and condensed to water in the 320 cold side. Membranes for MD require hydrophobic surface, high porosity, adequate 321 pore sizes with uniform pore size distribution, high liquid entry pressure, and 322 adequate mechanical strength (Yao et al. 2017 ). All of these properties can be 323 designed via nano ﬁber membrane structure using the electrospinning technique. 324 Hence, in the last 10 years, studies using nano ﬁber membranes for MD have seen 325 exponential surge due to their interesting and desirable properties. The membrane 326 properties and structure play a very important role in the process. Studies using 327 nanoﬁber membrane exhibited high water ﬂux while maintaining high salt rejection. 328 In comparison, the usual membrane used for MD tests is commercial PVDF or 329 PTFE ﬂat sheet membranes, which perform at relatively lower ﬂux and have 330 wetting issues. Our previous review article on the use of nano ﬁbers for MD presents 331 the promising potentialities of nano ﬁber membranes (Tijing et al. 2014a ). Recent 332 studies have focused on membrane development and modi ﬁcation especially on the 333 design of nano ﬁber membranes with added omniphobic properties, i.e., able to 334 reject almost all kinds of ﬂuid, including low surface tension liquids (see Fig. 20.3). 335 Nano ﬁber membranes are attractive in this design as the nano ﬁbers themselves 336 provide already rough surfaces, and can be further improved towards reentrant 337 surfaces or to have much lower surface energies to provide omniphobic surfaces 338 (Woo et al. 2017a ; Lee et al. 2016 ; Deng et al. 2018 ). 339 Various research groups aimed at making dual-layer membranes, superhydrophobic 340 membranes, and Janus-type membranes for MD. Dual-layer bicomponent com- 341 posite nano ﬁber membrane utilizing two wettability properties of both sides of the 342 membrane was prepared and tested for direct MD and obtained high ﬂux of 343 30 L/m2h (LMH) (Tijing et al. 2014b ). Additional investigation using different 344 dual-layered nano ﬁber membrane designs were done and tested using air gap MD 345 and compared with commercial membranes, and still obtained very high ﬂuxes and 346 high salt rejection using 3.5 wt% NaCl solution as feed (Park et al. 2015 ). Another 347 study made a different approach, wherein they electrospun polyvinyl alcohol 348 nanoﬁbers incorporated with Triton-X directly on polypropylene (PP) mat. The PP 349 mat, in this case, serves as the hydrophobic layer facing the feed, and the440 L. D.

They found 1.5 –2 times higher ﬂux of this 352 dual-layer membrane compared with PP mat alone. However, the process mecha- 353 nism is not clearly elucidated. Nanoparticles are also quite commonly used as 354 nanoﬁllers to improve the nano ﬁber properties. The incorporation of carbon nan- 355 otubes (Tijing et al. 2016 ), graphene (Woo et al. 2016 ), TiO 2-FTCS (Ren et al. 356 2017a ) into and on nano ﬁbers has added functionality and improved wettability 357 (superhydrophobicity) on the nano ﬁber membranes that result in improved ﬂux and 358 salt rejection performance even for high salinity brines. Posttreatment of nano ﬁber 359 membranes has also been found to improve the overall properties of the membrane 360 by increasing its mechanical strength, and enabling smaller and more uniform pore 361 sizes (Yao et al. 2017 ). 362 A recent study used nano ﬁbers as a coating material to a hollow ﬁber membrane 363 via continuous electrospinning for use in MD (Su et al. 2017 ). The hollow ﬁber 364 membrane served as the collector and the nano ﬁbers were directly collected on the 365 surface of the hollow ﬁber membranes (see Fig. 20.4). MD performance results of 366 these nano ﬁber-hollow ﬁber membranes indicated a good ﬂux of 17 LMH at feed 367 and permeate side temperatures of 60 and 20 °C, respectively. Superhydrophobic 368 titania nano ﬁbers modi ﬁed with ﬂuorination was recently prepared and tested for its 369 DCMD performance (Fan et al. 2017 ). The titania nano ﬁbers showed higher ﬂux 370 (12 LMH) and maintained excellent rejection (99.92%) compared with corre- 371 sponding ceramic membranes. 372 Nano ﬁber membranes for MD pose promising results so far and have been 373 competitive in overall performance compared with existing micro ﬁltration mem- 374 branes. Still lacking though is the long-term performance tests of most reported 375 nanoﬁber membranes for MD, and also dealing with scaling and fouling problems 376 when exposed with challenging waters. However, the potential of nano ﬁber 377 membranes for MD is looking positive, though the issues of energy source and Fig. 20.3 (Top) Schematic of the membrane distillationsystem showing modi ﬁed nanoﬁber membrane (SEM image inset) that hasomniphobic properties;(bottom) photographic images of liquid droplets on modi ﬁed nanoﬁber membrane providing resistance towicking from liquids with different surface tensions.

FO uses 381 a semipermeable membrane between two ﬂuids with different osmotic pressures. 382 This osmotic pressure difference drives the water from the feed solution to pass 383 through the membrane and dilute the draw solution (Phuntsho et al. 2011 ). Thus, 384 the FO membrane is very essential to the process (Xu et al. 2017 ). A selective 385 membrane with low internal concentration polarization (ICP) is desirable. There 386 have been promising developments in FO membranes and processes in the last 387 decade. FO membranes are usually made of three parts: very thin selective layer, a 388 middle layer, and a backing/support layer for mechanical stability. In recent years, 389 nanoﬁber layers utilized as middle or backing layer have been investigated to 390 reduce the ICP effects in FO. 391 Tian et al. ( 2017 ) investigated the effect of silica nanoparticle incorporation on a 392 polyetherimide (PEI) nano ﬁber support layer of FO membrane subjected to 393 heat-pressing on their FO performance via reduction of ICP effects. The silica/ 394 PEI-supported thin ﬁlm composite membrane showed higher porosity and pore 395 sizes and exhibited higher osmotic water ﬂux. Their result showed an optimum 396 content of 1.6 wt% of silica to produce 83% porosity and the smallest structural 397 parameter of 174 lm. When deionized water as feed and 1.0 M NaCl solution as 398 draw solution were used, 42 and 72 LMH were obtained when the active layer is 399 facing the feed, and when the active layer is facing the draw solution, respectively. 400 Park et al. ( 2018 ) designed a PVDF nano ﬁber support layer coated with 401 cross-linked PVA to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane and overall 402 reduce the ICP effects. Interfacial polymerization was used to make the polyamide 403 selective layer.

However, commercial nano ﬁbers are now available for 408 various applications (e.g., air ﬁltration) and are mostly supported with backing 409 layers. Chowdhury et al. ( 2017 ) decided to investigate the use of commercial 410 unsupported nano ﬁber membrane (from DuPont) to apply interfacial polymeriza- 411 tion and tested for FO performance. Interestingly, this nano ﬁber membrane with 412 selective polyamide layer produced twice the water ﬂux and one-tenth of the 413 reverse solute ﬂux compared with corresponding commercial TFC FO membrane. 414 The mechanical integrity of this nano ﬁber membrane was also high enough and is 415 even better than typical electrospun materials found in the laboratory. 416 A promising upscaling strategy for the use of continuous fabrication of 417 nanoﬁber-supported FO membrane with interfacial polymerization has been 418 reported (Son et al. 2018 ). In this study, nano ﬁbers were directly electrospun onto a 419 heated (150 °C) collector that sandwiches the nano ﬁber layer, and then thereafter, 420 interfacial polymerization is applied (see Fig. 20.5). The researchers tested the 421 fabricated thin ﬁlm nanocomposite membrane in engineered osmosis and obtained 422 high permeability of 30 LMH with excellent selectivity (17 g/m2h and 0.57 g/L). 423 Nano ﬁber membranes in FO show promising results achieving high ﬂuxes and 424 reduced ICP in ﬂuence, however, as the FO membrane needs a thin selective layer, 425 the synthesis of the dense polyamide top layer remains a challenge. This is because 426 the structure of the nano ﬁber layer is not smooth, there is a high tendency for the 427 top selective layer to be delaminated as not all of the surface are adhered well on the 428 crevices or valleys of the overlapping nano ﬁbers. Besides, during the polyamide 429 interfacial polymerization, there is a high tendency for the PA layer to penetrate the 430 pores of the nano ﬁber membranes which are generally bigger in size. In addition, 431 the mechanical integrity of unsupported nano ﬁber membrane is also put into Fig. 20.5 Schematic of the three steps to fabricate thin ﬁlm nano ﬁber composite membrane via electrospinning, thermal rolling, and interfacial polymerization.

Page 14,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF432 question, thus there is still lots of room for improvement in the use of such 433 nanoﬁbers for FO. 434 Nano ﬁbers as Electrodes for Capacitive Deionization (CDI) . Capacitive 435 deionization is based in electrosorption technique wherein cations and anions from 436 a saline solution are adsorbed on the electrodes via the application of electric 437 potential usually less than 2 V on two oppositely charged electrodes. The elec- 438 trosorption behavior is primarily dependent on the electrode material (Porada et al. 439 2012 ). The material needs the following properties for it to be ideal for CDI: a) 440 large surface area, large capacitance, high conductivity, high electrochemical sta- 441 bility, and easy to manufacture (Oren 2008 ). With these electrode criteria in mind, 442 electrospun nano ﬁbers that are carbonized and boasting of high speci ﬁc surface area 443 are highly potential materials as electrodes. In addition, the ease in adding func- 444 tionalities to electrospun nano ﬁbers makes them more attractive as electrode 445 materials. Hence, a number of recent research have been conducted on designing 446 nanoﬁber as electrode materials for CDI. 447 Among the materials, electrospun porous carbon nano ﬁbers have gained quite an 448 attention for CDI electrode. However, the microporosity of such carbon nano ﬁbers 449 is less desirable as an electrode as it offers resistance to ion transport in inner pores 450 and could act as deep trap sites. Thus, to address this challenge, Wang et al. ( 2016 ) 451 developed hierarchical porous carbon electrode with tailored structures for CDI. 452 The structure is a combination of micropore, mesopores, and macropores, which 453 they claim to promote mass transport. Their fabrication strategy was to combine 454 electrospinning with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) template method (Fig. 20.6). The 455 resulting hierarchical porous carbon nano ﬁber electrode obtained an adsorption 456 capacity of 7.61 mg/g and the charge ef ﬁciency was 23.7%. The adsorption 457 capacity and the charge ef ﬁciency were better by 1.87 and 1.51 times, respectively, 458 compared with those of the traditional parallel ﬂow by CDI structure. Another 459 group (Zhang et al. 2018 ) also synthesized hierarchical porous carbon nanotubes/ 460 graphene/carbon nano ﬁbers obtaining very high salt capacity of 36 mg/g and large 461 retention absorbing capability of 96.9%. However, the cost of this electrode may be 462 a challenge due to the materials used. 463 Liu et al. ( 2016a ) investigated the CDI application performance of carbon 464 nanoﬁbers-reinforced 3D porous carbon polyhedral network. The carbon nano ﬁbers 465 were prepared by electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nano ﬁbers as pre- 466 cursor followed by carbonization. This new design of electrode showed an elec- 467 trosorption capacity of 16.98 mg/g at 1.2 V using 500 mg/L NaCl solution, which 468 was better compared to baseline electrospun carbon nano ﬁbers. Some metal oxides 469 such as ZrO 2(Yasin et al. 2017 ), TiO 2(Yasin et al. 2018 ), and MnO x(Zhao et al. 470 2017a ) are also available materials for CDI electrodes as they possess properties 471 that are desirable for CDI such as high durability in the aqueous solution, and good 472 hydrophilicity to improve electrode wettability. 473 Nanomaterials including nano ﬁbers could be promising materials for use as CDI 474 electrodes due to their many interesting properties and functionalities that can lead 475 to improved desalination performance (Gaikwad and Balomajumder 2016 ).444 L.

Page 15,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF 476 However, many of the studies reported lack economic analysis of the use of such 477 materials, which may increase their cost. Also, the stability of such nano ﬁber/ 478 nanomaterials needs to be further investigated. 479 Nano ﬁbers as Barrier/Mid-layer for Reverse Osmosis (RO) . RO is considered 480 as the state of the art in desalination and continues to be used for new desalination 481 plants around the world. It has high desalination ef ﬁciency yet it still is a very 482 energy-intensive process (Shenvi et al. 2015 ). The membrane is the heart of the RO 483 process providing the barrier needed for selective permeation. But aside from being 484 highly selective, the good membrane should minimize fouling formation and should 485 have the high mechanical stability to withstand the high pressure applied to the 486 membrane. Thin ﬁlm composite membranes, which contain a dense thin selective 487 layer and a porous polymeric support layer, are the most commonly used type of 488 membranes in RO (Xu et al. 2013 ). Several researches have been done to improve 489 the performance of the RO membrane and one of the recent ones involved the use 490 of nano ﬁbers as an additional layer material of the RO membrane. However, 491 nanoﬁbers are usually not prepared for RO test due to exposure to very high 492 pressure that nano ﬁber membrane may not be able to withstand. 493 A recent interesting RO membrane design by Wang et al. ( 2017a ) incorporated 494 ultraﬁne cellulose nano ﬁbers as the barrier layer, electrospun PAN nano ﬁbers as the 495 mid-layer, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) nonwoven mat as the mechanical 496 support. This makes up as an ultra ﬁltration membrane, and the addition of the 497 interfacially polymerized polyamide top selective layer makes it a thin composite 498 membrane that can be used for RO application. In addition, the spray coating 499 technique was also utilized to control the thickness of the selective layer during 500 polymerization. This new membrane design with nano ﬁber incorporation has 501 achieved 96.5% rejection using 500 ppm NaCl as feed and a ﬂux of 28.6 LMH 502 under 0.7 MPa pressure, which was comparable with high ﬂux commercial RO 503 membrane.

Solar desalination, in this case, refers to the use of solar energy as a 512 heat source to separate water molecules from the salts and impurities via evapo- 513 ration –condensation process. Solar distillation process has been used for a long time 514 by just simply exposing a wide area of seawater to the sun, and letting the evap- 515 oration to occur, and capturing the vapors via a cooling plate to condense back to 516 pure water (Kabeel and El-Agouz 2011 ). However, this process takes a long time to 517 occur as the mechanism is based on bulk heating rather than just surface heating of 518 the surface water. Recently, a few studies were carried out designing ﬂoating 519 materials on the saline water, wherein the ﬂoated porous materials have the ability 520 to absorb solar heat and heat itself up thereby providing localized heating of the 521 interface between the material and surface water, enabling more rapid evaporation 522 (Wang 2018 ). The water then passes through the porous structure of the material 523 and proceed with the condensation (Chen et al. 2018a ; Zhou et al. 2016a ). 524 Nano ﬁber membranes with or without photonic or light-absorbing particles have 525 been tested for such application. 526 Chen et al. ( 2018a ) investigated the ef ﬁcacy of a nano ﬁber-based composite ﬁlm 527 loaded with plasmonic gold nanoparticle on its solar steam generation. Figure 20.7 528 shows the schematic of the solar generation process and the new nano ﬁber-based 529 membrane for solar steam generation.

With 536 exploding population and rapid development in agriculture, manufacturing, and 537 mining, the availability and use of more products like pesticides, fertilizers, 538 chemicals, and heavy metals have led to increased leakage/discharge their con- 539 stituents into groundwater. Such contaminants, which are very complex and dif ﬁ- 540 cult to eradicate, can seriously in ﬂuence the ecosystem in groundwater, aquifers, 541 and soil. Therefore, developing groundwater remediation strategies is of high 542 necessity to address the challenges in the increasingly serious groundwater 543 pollution. 544 Groundwater remediation technologies are basically classi ﬁed into two ways: 545 pump and treat technology (P&T) and in situ remediation technology. For P&T 546 (Truex et al. 2017 ), contaminated groundwater is pumped out from the aquifer and 547 then treated externally in a treatment building. Thus, all the surface water treatments 548 such as adsorption, ﬁltration, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be 549 utilized for groundwater remediation. This also opens up for the possibility of using 550 nanoﬁbers as main or substrate material for the mentioned treatment processes that 551 can be utilized for P&T groundwater remediation. 552 For in situ groundwater remediation, methods are very limited due to the 553 complex geological conditions, dif ﬁculties in construction, and the instability of 554 sampling and detection. Classical treatments include permeable reactive barrier 555 (PRB) technology and direct injection of adsorbents, oxidizers, or reducing agents. 556 As nano ﬁbers can be made into membranes, they can also be potentially utilized as 557 materials for PRB that can be placed into the aquifer to block the plume and treat 558 groundwater. 559 Nano ﬁber for groundwater remediation can be used in two forms based on the 560 dominant role in the treatment process. One is to utilize nano ﬁber itself to remove 561 contaminants in the groundwater. The other is to employ the nano ﬁber as a carrier 562 or substrate to facilitate immobilization of the existing materials/technologies used 563 for groundwater remediation. For example, nano ﬁbers have been used in adsorption 564 andﬁltration due to their high speci ﬁc surface area and easy surface functional- 565 ization. (Haider et al. 2015 ). Heavy metals (like chromium, copper, cadmium, lead, 566 arsenic, and mercury) and organic pollutants (chloride organics, dyes and etc.) are 567 the main contaminants in groundwater generally remediated by adsorption process 568 (Aliabadi et al. 2013 ). Adsorption works mainly via af ﬁnities (like physical af ﬁnity, 569 electrostatic interaction, chemical chelation, and complexation) between contami- 570 nants and functional groups on adsorbents (Huang et al. 2014 ). Studies have shown 571 that polymers containing different functional groups such as amino, carboxyl, 572 phosphoric, etc., have good complexation af ﬁnities toward metals ions and were 573 commonly selected to fabricate nano ﬁbers for heavy metal adsorption (Haider et al. 574 2015 ). Polyacrylic acid (PAA) with a large number of –COOH group is widely used 575 as a complexing agent.

Chitpong and Husson ( 2017 ) grafted PAA polymer 577 onto poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) nano ﬁber and the fabricated 578 PAA-PGMA membrane obtained good removal of cadmium with maximum 579 capacities that exceeded 160 mg/g. Xiao et al. employed electrospun PAA/PVA 580 nanoﬁbers for the removal of metal ions from aqueous solution. The nano ﬁber 581 membrane showed the exceptional removal of copper ions (91% removal within 582 3 h) and it also showed superb selectivity in the presence of calcium ions (Xiao 583 et al. 2010 ). 584 Nano ﬁber can also be fabricated as membranes used into ﬁltration process for 585 groundwater remediation. Permeability, rejection capability, and service life are the 586 three most important factors for the selection of membrane in ﬁltration process. 587 Permeability and rejection capacity are mainly determined by pore size, porosity, 588 surface charges, and hydrophilicity. Pore size and porosity can basically be con- 589 trolled by changing the ﬁber size of nano ﬁber membrane. Electrospun nano ﬁber can 590 easily be manipulated to control ﬁber size from nanoscale to microscale by 591 changing polymer concentration, introducing additives or adjusting electrospinning 592 parameters. Therefore, some studies have reported using electrospun nano ﬁber 593 membranes into micro ﬁltration (MF) and ultra ﬁltration (UF) processes. Bae et al. 594 (2016 ) fabricated a polyethersulfone (PES) electrospun nano ﬁber membrane and 595 employ the membrane into MF for the removal of bovine serum albumin (BSA). 596 Wang et al. ( 2017b ). electrospun regenerated cellulose nano ﬁber membranes 597 surface-grafted with water-insoluble poly(HEMA) or water-soluble poly(AAS) 598 chains via the ATRP method for ultra ﬁltration of water. The surface hydrophilicity 599 of the nano ﬁbers can be modi ﬁed by introducing materials with hydrophilic 600 functional groups such as –COOH and –OH. Jang et al. ( 2015 ) introduced graphene 601 oxide (GO, with –COOH and –OH) into electrospun polyvinylidene ﬂuoride 602 (PVDF) nano ﬁber for MF process and the PVDF-GO achieved three times 603 improvement in permeation ﬂux. For the removal of charged contaminants, surface 604 charges on the nano ﬁber can be modi ﬁed by introducing charged polymer. 605 Interestingly, for the adsorption process, nano ﬁbers should be introduced with 606 opposing electrical charge to contaminants for a better attraction and immobiliza- 607 tion of contaminants. However, on the contrary, for the membrane ﬁltration pro- 608 cess, nano ﬁbers are expected to have same electrical charge with contaminants to 609 increase the rejection of contaminants and alleviate membrane fouling from the 610 afﬁnity of foulants by electrostatic repulsion effect. Han et al. prepared a 611 surface-charged PVDF nano ﬁber MF membrane through a direct sulfonation 612 reaction, which both increased the rejection of contaminants and reduced the 613 fouling by improving electrostatic repulsion between membrane surfaces and 614 charged polystyrene (PS) latex suspensions as feed solution (Han et al. 2011 ). 615 However, individual nano ﬁbers have some restrictions and are not adequate to 616 cope in treatment with all the contaminants in groundwater. Incorporating with 617 other materials/technologies in the existing groundwater remediation can both 618 improve the performance of nano ﬁber and existing remediation technology. For 619 instance, nanoscale zero-valent iron particles (nZVI), with its the high reactivity 620 towards a broad range of contaminants, have been a commonly used material/AQ4448 L. D.

However, nZVI 622 particles themselves are prone to agglomeration and sedimentation (Xue et al. 2018 ; 623 Liu et al. 2014a ). Traditional methods to combat agglomeration are to add sur- 624 factants (Tian et al. 2018 ), and stabilizers (Schiwy et al. 2016 ) to maintain the 625 uniformity and activity of nZVI particles. Nevertheless, those auxiliary additives 626 and contaminants adsorbed on nZVI may be released and can be a source of 627 secondary pollution if not properly retrieved (Lefevre et al. 2016 ). Electrospun 628 nanoﬁber membrane with its high speci ﬁc surface area, recyclable and easily 629 functionalized properties is an ideal material for nZVI immobilization to avoid 630 agglomeration and sedimentation. With nano ﬁbers as carrier, it provides an 631 opportunity for regeneration of the membrane, thus avoiding the release of nZVIs 632 and potential secondary pollution. (Yang et al. 2014 ).

( 2014b ) 633 immobilized nZVI onto polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based oxidized mat to reduce 634 water contaminants (including methylene blue and trichloroethylene), and their 635 results showed excellent performance on the removal of the target contaminants. 636 Another study reported on the use of chitosan ﬁber-supported nZVI particles, which 637 showed excellent sorption performance for inorganic arsenic uptake at concentra- 638 tion ranging from 0.01 to 5.00 mg/L (Horzum et al. 2013 ). Ren et al. ( 2017b ) 639 successfully immobilized 48.8 wt% nZVI onto a high ratio of PAA/PVA nano ﬁber 640 mat and the nZVI –PAA –PVA had high removals to both methylene blue and 641 copper ions. 642 Nano ﬁber can also be a support layer for other ﬁltration processes or active layer 643 based on other materials. Bahmani et al. ( 2017 ) employed electrospun polyethylene 644 terephthalate (PET) nano ﬁber scaffold as a support layer to increase mechanical 645 strength and fabricated PAN nano ﬁber as an active layer onto the PET scaffold. The 646 thinﬁlm composite (TFC) membrane showed 172 –520% higher ﬂux and improved 647 rejection of arsenate ions when compared with the UF membrane. 648 For the risk control of potential pollution from nano ﬁber, researchers also 649 developed biodegradable and recyclable nano ﬁber to avoid secondary pollution. 650 Varanasi et al. ( 2015 ) developed a biodegradable and recyclable cellulose nano ﬁbre 651 composite, which showed a decent water ﬂux of 80 LMH and MWCO of 200 kDa 652 in UF process. 653 The interesting and desirable properties of nano ﬁbers such as large speci ﬁc 654 surface area, controllable ﬁber sizes, ease of fabrication, high ﬂexibility to surface 655 modiﬁcation, and strong compatibility with other technologies make them highly 656 potential for use in water treatment and groundwater remediation. However, still 657 there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed on the use and design of 658 nanoﬁbers, for example, generally weaker mechanical properties, the less tested 659 long-term performance and stability, mass production issues, among others, thus 660 continuous and more rigorous research are still needed to ful ﬁll its promising 661 potential.20 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 449Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 449/468",911
Page 20,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF66220.3.2 Nano ﬁbers for Wastewater Treatment 663 Nano ﬁbers as Membrane for Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) . The feasibility of 664 using nano ﬁber membranes for MBR application has recently been investigated by 665 several groups. Nano ﬁber membranes share similar pore sizes with MF membranes 666 in the range of 0.1 –10lm, making them applicable for MBR process which uses 667 MF membranes. Bjorge et al. were the ﬁrst group to investigate the performance of 668 nanoﬁbrous membranes in MBR application (Bjorge et al. 2009 ,2010 ). They uti- 669 lized polyamide (PA) nano ﬁbers for their MBR process. Based on their results, they 670 found that nano ﬁbers suffered rapid decay of ﬂux because of the irreversible fouling 671 formed on the electrospun membrane. The PA nano ﬁbers were also found to have 672 low removal ef ﬁciency for pathogen removal, even though the integration of Ag 673 nanoparticles promoted the removal of Gram-negative bacteria. Their report did not 674 provide much positive result on the use of nano ﬁber membranes but gave a glimpse 675 of potential opportunities for improving the nano ﬁber design and properties. Later, 676 Bilad et al. improved the nano ﬁbrous PA membrane performance in MBR by 677 heat-treating the membranes (Bilad et al. 2011 ). Rapid ﬂux decay was prevented, as 678 the heat treatment greatly improved the integrity and mechanical strength of the 679 nanoﬁber membranes; hence, the heat-treated electrospun membranes showed 680 comparable ﬂux performance to the commercial membranes (Fig. 20.8). Also, their 681 use of more hydrophilic PA6 improved the permeation ﬂux in MBR. However, the 682 authors suggested further studies on the electrospun membrane improvement as the 683 heat-treated nano ﬁbrous membranes still suffered the intrusion of sludge in 684 long-term operation, which led to the gradual increase in the fouling formation. 685 Moradi et al. developed electrospun membrane using PAN, a polymer with high 686 mechanical and thermal stability. Moreover, PAN is also one of the easiest Fig. 20.8 Theﬂux stepping proﬁles of electrospun and commercial membranes (Bilad et al. 2011 )450 L. D.

Page 21,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF687 polymers to electrospin to fabricate nano ﬁber membranes (Moradi et al. 2018 ). The 688 authors also considered high fouling resistance of PAN to be an interesting property 689 that is attractive for MBR application. The antifouling resistance of PAN mem- 690 branes was further improved with the aid of fumarate alumoxane nanoparticles, 691 integrated into the membrane matrix. The nanoparticles, at optimal concentrations, 692 greatly improved the fouling resistance by increasing the hydrophilicity of the 693 membranes, owing to the rich hydroxyl and carboxylate groups on the nanoparticle 694 surfaces. However, too high concentration of the fumarate alumoxane nanoparticles 695 also led to aggregation, blocking nano ﬁbrous membrane pores, and hence reduced 696 permeation ﬂux in MBR (Moradi et al. 2018 ). Overall, the PAN nano ﬁbrous 697 membranes loaded with nanoparticles showed promising performance with greatly 698 reduced irreversible fouling in MBR. 699 Nano ﬁbers as Membrane or Adsorbent for Oil –Water Separation . Owing to 700 frequent oil spill accidents in recent years, there is an increasing need for novel and 701 efﬁcient technologies for oil/water separation. Gravity-driven membrane separation, 702 an energy-ef ﬁcient versatile technology, is generally considered one of the most 703 promising technologies (Arslan et al. 2016 ). For proper separation of oil and water 704 emulsion using gravity-driven method, one important factor needed for the 705 separation materials is the engineered surface wetting properties, either to be 706 superhydrophobic and superoleophilic, or superhydrophilic and underwater- 707 superoleophobic. Electrospinning is a desirable technique to produce membranes 708 with pore size, and pore size distribution suitable for gravity-driven applications, 709 which also boast of ease in surface modi ﬁcation and functionalization. The rela- 710 tively easier approach to fabricate membranes for oil/water separation was to 711 directly electrospin low surface tension polymer membranes; polystyrene, 712 polyvinylidene ﬂuoride, or polytetra ﬂuoroethylene membranes had been fabricated 713 in one-step electrospinning (Kim et al. 2013 ; Zhou and Wu 2015 ; Qing et al. 2017 ). 714 Although without modi ﬁcation, these membranes showed superhydrophobic and 715 superoleophilic properties, thus performing ef ﬁciently in oil/water separation pro- 716 cess. Some other researchers developed approaches to impart superhydrophobicity 717 and superoleophilicity to the hydrophilic membranes by surface modi ﬁcations. Li 718 et al. coated the silver nanocluster on the nano ﬁbrous PAN membranes, followed 719 by superhydrophobization; thus, a high contact angle and low sliding angle of water 720 were realized, and the membranes could treat the oily wastewater for 30 cycles with 721 good stability (Li et al. 2014 ). Arslan et al. developed per ﬂuoro-modi ﬁed electro- 722 spun cellulose acetate membranes through sol-gel methods; the modi ﬁed mem- 723 branes had a high water contact angle but low oil contact angle, which worked well 724 in oil/water separation for 5 cycles (Arslan et al. 2016 ). Chen et al. chose the elastic 725 polyurethane and chromatic polydiacetylenes for electrospinning because of their 726 high mechanical stability and chemical resistance; after UV treatment, and later on 727 heat treatment, the membranes became superhydrophobic with water contact angle 728 higher than 155°, which could remain stable even after 1000 stretching cycles. The 729 elastic nano ﬁbrous membranes maintained high removal ef ﬁciency for 12 cycles 730 (Chen et al. 2018b ) (Fig. 20.9). Liu et al. improved the hydrophobicity of PVDF20 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 451Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 451/468",970

These modi ﬁcation processes made the nano ﬁber membranes 733 superhydrophibic (water contact angle of 171°) while maintaining the oil contact 734 angle of 0° (Liu et al. 2016b ). The modi ﬁed PVDF membrane showed much 735 improved antifouling resistance and oil/water separation ef ﬁciency for dozens of 736 cycles. One research group investigated electrospun membrane formed from car- 737 bonaceous materials, as they argued that the polymer membranes were prone 738 degradation from chemical cleaning, which is necessary in oil/water separation (Tai 739 et al. 2014 ). SiO 2-Carbon membranes were fabricated using electrospinning, and 740 after being coated with silicone, the inorganic membrane became superhydrophobic 741 and superoleophilic, while maintaining its high chemical and thermal stability. The 742 other bene ﬁt of such membrane was that, unlike polymer membranes, its wettability 743 was not affected by pH of the wastewater. 744 The other approach of gravity-driven membrane separation for oil/water sepa- 745 ration was using superhydrophilic and underwater-superoleophobic membrane. To 746 achieve such membrane surface property, surface modi ﬁcation was necessary.

Page 23,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF747 Ahmed et al. directed coated cellulose –ionic liquid solution on electrospun PVDF 748 membrane to modify its surface properties. This led to superhydophilic property 749 (water contact angle of 0°) and superoleophobic underwater (dichloromethane 750 contact angle of 169° underwater) (Ejaz Ahmed et al. 2014 ). The membranes 751 showed high separation ef ﬁciency for most types of oil. Obaid et al. modi ﬁed the 752 polysulfone electrospun membranes surface by generating one thin layer of poly- 753 amide on top, and its contact angle of water dropped from 130° to 13° (Obaid et al. 754 2015 ). The membrane maintained three consecutive cycles of high water ﬂux in oil/ 755 water separation. Hydrophilic inorganic additives, SiO 2, and graphene oxide had 756 also been individually incorporated into the electrospun nano ﬁbrous membranes, 757 and hence greatly decreased the contact angle of water (to around 20°). These 758 membranes had improved oil/water separation ef ﬁciency and durability (Zhang 759 et al. 2017 ; Islam et al. 2017 ). Membrane surface with hierarchical structure was 760 achieved on the cross-linked polyacrylonitrile/hyperbranched polyethyleneimine 761 electrospun membranes; thus, it had a water contact angle of 0° and underwater oil 762 contact angle of 163°. The composite membranes achieved strong antifouling 763 property, so it maintained high ﬂux and rejection in 10 cycles (Wang et al. 2018 ). 764 For the sake of improved versatility with a controllable surface wettability, smart 765 materials were introduced in the electrospun nano ﬁbrous for gravity-driven oil/ 766 water separation membranes. Responsive to the pH of the wastewater, these 767 membranes could switch between superhydrophobic/superoleophilic and 768 superhydrophilic/underwater-superoleophobic (Li et al. 2015 ; Cheng et al. 2017 ). In 769 addition, incorporated with decanoic acid, the modi ﬁed electrospun polyimide 770 membrane could become superhydrophilic from superhydrophobic, if exposed to 771 ammonia vapor (Mino et al. 2017 ). 772 Nano ﬁbers as Omniphobic Membrane for Produced Water Treatment . 773 Produced water, mainly from oil ﬁeld or gas ﬁeld, is becoming a major challenge for 774 wastewater treatment under current tightening environmental regulation, as its high 775 total dissolved solids make reverse osmosis, the currently most ef ﬁcient water 776 separation technology, impractical (Woo et al. 2017b ). Therefore, membrane dis- 777 tillation, one of few technologies able to treat highly saline wastewater, was being 778 developed as a solution. However, low surface tension compounds and oil emulsion, 779 commonly found in the produced water, made the hydrophobic membrane suscep- 780 tible to membrane wetting, which could greatly affect the permeation performance 781 and even halt the operation (Yao et al. 2018 ). Due to its controllable pore size range 782 and ease of modi ﬁcation, electrospun nano ﬁber membranes were developed into 783 barriers with anti-surfactant and anti-low-surface-tension-compound properties. Till 784 now, two major approaches were established: (1) Omniphobic membrane surface; 785 (2) Janus membrane (superhydrophilic and underwater oleophobic surface layer 786 with superhydrophobic or omniphobic bottom layer). Through CF 4plasma treat- 787 ment, Woo et al. modi ﬁed the electrospun PVDF membrane to obtain omniphobicity 788 on its surface (Woo et al. 2017b ). The omniphobic membrane had high contact angle 789 of both water and low surface tension liquids (mineral oil and methanol), as well as a 790 greatly decreased water sliding angle to 50° if the membranes had been20 Nano ﬁbers for Water and Wastewater Treatment … 453Layout: T1_Standard Book ID: 471841_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-13-2982-1 Chapter No.: 20 Date: 11-10-2018 Time: 11:08 am Page: 453/468",983

When treating real produced water containing 792 high concentrations of surfactant in the con ﬁguration of DCMD, while the com- 793 mercial membrane suffered rapid wetting, the modi ﬁed electrospun membranes had 794 no wetting issues and maintained stable ﬂux and 99.99% salt rejection. Alternately, 795 coating 1H,1H,2H,2H-per ﬂuorodecyltriethoxysilane followed by heat treatment 796 could impart omniphobicity to PVDF-HFP nano ﬁber membranes (An et al. 2018 ). 797 The modi ﬁed membrane had high contact angle for both water and oil, and the 798 property of omniphobicity was robust even under harsh circumstances. Without an 799 expense to performance, the omniphobic membrane successfully treated the pro- 800 duced water containing surfactant of sodium dodecyl sulfate for more than 2 h. 801 Electrospun inorganic membranes could be modi ﬁed to acquire omniphobicity as 802 well. Huang developed omniphobic silica-based membranes with high surfactant 803 resistance (Huang et al. 2017a ). The omniphobicity of membrane was contributed by 804 two factors: reentrant structures induced by coaxial technique (sheath solution for 805 second scale nanostructure), and low surface tension after being dip-coated in 806 1H,1H,2H,2H-per ﬂuorodecyltriethoxysilane. The omniphobic electrospun silica 807 membrane had very high contact angle and stable MD performance against wetting 808 when treating produced water containing surfactants. 809 To further improve the wetting resistance, Huang et al. developed a Janus 810 membrane containing an omniphobic substrate (Huang et al. 2017b ). PVDF-HFP 811 membrane substrates containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were fabricated 812 using electrospinning, and coated with ﬂuorinated silica nanoparticles thus the 813 substrate became omniphobic. Then, a layer of silica nanoparticles, chitosan, and 814 perﬂuorooctanoate was spray-coated on the omniphobic substrate, forming a Janus 815 membrane. The Janus membranes, showing greatly improved wetting and fouling 816 resistance against troublesome compounds (oil emulsion and surfactant) in the 817 produced water, had no degradation of ﬂux and rejection performance for 10 h MD 818 operation. An alternate approach to form a hydrophilic layer in a Janus membrane 819 was electrospinning. A nano ﬁbrous network comprising both cellulose acetate and 820 silica nanoparticles could be simultaneously coated on a hydrophobic PTFE sub- 821 strate in one-step electrospinning; a low water contact angle of 40° and high 822 underwater oil contact angle of 154° were achieved (Hou et al. 2018 ) (Fig. 20.10 ). 823 For 30 h, the electrospun-modi ﬁed Janus membrane had stable performance 824 treating saline water which contained oil-in-water emulsion. 825 Nano ﬁbers as Membrane or Adsorbent for Dye Wastewater Treatment . 826 Organic dye contaminants, greatly found in textile wastewater, posed great risks to 827 both ecological system and human health. As these contaminants had high resis- 828 tance against heat, and oxidizing light, treatment before their discharge was the best 829 approach to minimize their impacts. Various physiochemical treatment processes, 830 including adsorption, ﬁltration, coagulation –ﬂocculation, biological treatment, 831 chlorination, electrochemical, and photocatalytic degradation, had been developed 832 (Chen et al. 2018c ). Membrane electrospinning has simple manufacturing processes 833 and could conveniently acquire various functions with controllable pore sizes; thus,454 L. D.

Page 25,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF 834 a great number of dye treatment technology had been developed based on elec- 835 trospun nano ﬁber membranes. 836 Direct ﬁltration had been developed to separate the dye compounds from the 837 water. Zhao fabricated b-cyclodextrin-based electrospun membranes which had a 838 high ﬂow rate of 150 ml/min for ﬁve cycles when separating cationic dye methy- 839 lene blue from anionic dye methyl, owing to the strong electrostatic repulsion 840 between the carboxyl groups on the membrane and the negative electricity of 841 anionic dyes (Zhao et al. 2015a ). Incorporating graphene oxide in the PVDF 842 spinning solution, Ghaffar et al. developed a membrane having 99% selectivity 843 towards cationic dyes with a ﬂux of 439 LMH (Ghaffar et al. 2018 ). On the other 844 side, electrospun membranes had been speci ﬁcally designed to reject the anionic 845 dyes by incorporating nanomaterials in the hydrophilic membranes. With the 846 addition of 0.5 wt% SiO 2in the spinning solution, the PVA nano ﬁber membrane 847 was able to remove 98% of Direct Red 23 with a high ﬂux of 1711 LMH (Hosseini 848 et al. 2018 ). Coated with graphene oxide with the aid of polydopamine, the elec- 849 trospun PEN membrane was able to remove 92.6% Direct Blue 14 with a ﬂux of 850 141.5 LMH (Zhan et al. 2018 ). Electrospun membranes capable of removing both 851 cationic and anionic dyes were also developed. Shi and coworkers fabricated 852 branch-like carboxylated MWCNTS/Chitosan nano ﬁber membranes; they had high 853 rejection of both methylene blue (86%) and methyl orange (83%) while maintaining 854 high ﬂux higher than 3500 LMH (Shi et al. 2016 ). Multilayer electrospun nylon-6 855 membranes were the alternate approach to achieve such rejection. With greatly 856 decreased pore size owing to multilayer and increased thickness, the nano ﬁber 857 membranes achieved high removal rejection with relatively low ﬂux of 16 LMH 858 (Yu et al. 2018 ). Incorporated with graphene oxide, the multilayer nylon nano ﬁber 859 membranes had improved rejection of both methylene blue (99%) and methyl 860 orange (95%) without sacri ﬁcing the ﬂux performance (Chen et al. 2018c ). Treating 861 dye wastewater via MD with electrospun membrane was also explored. PDMS/ 862 PVDF nano ﬁber membrane showed high ﬂux and rejection rate and greatly reduced 863 irreversible fouling when treating anionic crystal violet (Vaselbehagh et al. 2017 ).

Page 26,"UNCORRECTEDPROOF864 Electrospun membranes could be used as adsorbents, another approach treating 865 dye in the wastewater. Some researchers used the nano ﬁbers as carriers of adsor- 866 bents, and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was the most common one. Various 867 adsorbents, including poly (acrylic acid), graphene oxide, polyethyleneimine, and 868 chitosan, had been coated on the PVA membranes; these adsorbent membranes had 869 high adsorption capacity in multiple consecutive cycles (Yan et al. 2015 ; Xing et al. 870 2017 ; Zhu et al. 2017 ; Habiba et al. 2017a ). To improve durability, Gopakumar 871 et al. developed adsorbent membrane based on PVDF membranes (Gopakumar 872 et al. 2017 ). Cellulose acetate nano ﬁber was incorporated into PVDF membranes 873 and modi ﬁed by Meldrum ’s Acid; thus, the membrane obtained a high adsorption 874 capacity of crystal violet of 3985 mg/g. After modi ﬁcation, the nano ﬁber mem- 875 branes alone could work as adsorbent. Amine-modi ﬁed electrospun polymer 876 membranes could adsorb methyl orange at a capacity of 312.5 mg/g (Satilmis and 877 Uyar 2018 ). Although having lower adsorption capacity of methylene blue than the 878 electrospun polymer adsorbent membranes, inorganic electrospun membranes made 879 of zeolites were successfully fabricated; they were easier and faster for separation 880 and reuse than the raw form of the minerals (Saepurahman and Hashaikeh 2015 ). 881 Similar to the adsorbent membrane, the electrospun nano ﬁber membranes could 882 work as carriers of the nanoparticles that photo-degrade the dyes. Li et al. incor- 883 porated TiO 2nanoparticle, a photocatalyst, on electrospun poly (methylmethacry- 884 late) membranes, which degraded Methylene Blue stably in 5 consecutive cycles 885 (Li et al. 2017a ) (Fig. 20.11 ). Others coated Ag@AgCl or H 4SiW 12O40on elec- 886 trospun cellulose acetate membranes, and the membranes degraded methyl orange 887 efﬁciently in three successive cycles (Zhou et al. 2016b ; Li et al. 2017b ). 888 Electrospun membranes made of inorganic photocatalyst materials was a more 889 direct approach to remove the dyes in wastewater. PVP (or PVA) is generally used 890 as a temporary carrier in the electrospinning process and is burned off after the 891 membranes are formed. Various materials, such as MoS 2, TiO 2, and SiO 2, can be 892 made into inorganic nano ﬁber membranes (Ren et al. 2018 ; Singh et al. 2017 ; Yang 893 et al. 2017 ; Wang et al. 2017c ). To improve the degradation ef ﬁciency, additional 894 particles (CoFe 2O4, Pt, and MnO 2) were incorporated to impart hierarchical 895 structure to the membrane surface. The inorganic membranes were able to degrade 896 the dyes in multiple cycles. Also, activated carbon nano ﬁber membranes can 897 degrade dyes. Electrospun membranes made of PAN, a precursor of activated 898 carbon, had porous hierarchical structure (Zhu et al. 2018 ; Lin et al. 2017 ) after 899 exposing to high thermal treatment. Also, the oxidation power of the carbon 900 materials could be enhanced by the incorporation of cobalt into the spinning 901 solution (Lin et al. 2017 ). After carbonization, the nano ﬁbrous membranes could 902 degrade the dye ef ﬁciently in ﬁve consecutive cycles. 903 Nano ﬁbers as Adsorbent for Removal of Heavy Metal Ions from Water/ 904 Wastewater . Heavy metal pollutants in the wastewater pose serious challenges to 905 human health because they are highly carcinogenic and hard to be decomposed or 906 biodegraded.

To increase the adsorption capacity, PVA or poly (ethy- 913 lene oxide) (PEO) was mixed with chitosan in the spinning solution; hence, the 914 electrospun nano ﬁber membranes had increased pore size owing to decreased 915 crystallinity (Li et al. 2018 ; Habiba et al. 2017b ; Shariful et al. 2017 ). To further 916 enhance the adsorption capacity of chitosan membranes, various additives, 917 including zeolite, halloysite nanotubes, and graphene oxide, had been used (Hadi 918 Najafabadi et al. 2015 ). The chitosan-based electrospun membranes achieved a high 919 removal ef ﬁciency of Cr(VI), Cu(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), and Fe(III) in multiple cycles. 920 Also, chitosan, cross-linked with rectorite, could be loaded onto electrospun 921 nanoﬁber substrate by electrospinning simultaneously. Huang et al. developed 922 chitosan-rectorite nanospheres embedded in aminated PAN nano ﬁber membranes to 923 efﬁciently treat Pb(II) (Huang et al. 2018 ); Tu and coworkers also fabricated 924 chitosan-rectorite nanospheres embedded polystyrene (PS) membranes to adsorb 925 Ca(II) (Tu et al. 2017 ). Even without additives, PS membranes alone exhibited 926 impressive adsorbent properties. 927 Alcaraz-Espinoza et al. developed hierarchical composite membranes by 928 applying polymerization of polyaniline on the PS nano ﬁber membranes; the 929 membranes could remediate Hg(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Cr(VI), and Cu(II) ions ef ﬁ- 930 ciently (Alcaraz-Espinoza et al. 2015 ). Due to their high mechanical strength, PAN 931 nanoﬁber membranes had been greatly used as the base/substrate of the membrane 932 adsorbent. Zhao and colleagues developed an amino-rich hydrothermal 933 carbon-coated electrospun PAN membranes which could absorb both cationic and 934 anionic pollutants. The membranes had high removal ef ﬁciency in ﬁve successive 935 cycles (Zhao et al. 2017b ).

The composite membranes showed strong Cu(II) 944 removal (Feng et al. 2018 ) (Fig. 20.12 ). Amidoxime groups could be imparted to 945 PAN and blended with regenerated cellulose; the electrospun PAN membranes 946 showed strong adsorption of Fe(III), Cu(II), and Cd(II). In ﬁve consecutive tests 947 using the membranes, the adsorption and desorption rate of the heavy metal ions 948 remained high. Cheaper polymers such as cellulose, PVA, or PVC were also used 949 as base polymer for electrospun membranes, which were modi ﬁed to acquire heavy 950 metal adsorption ability (Wu et al. 2015 ; Islam et al. 2015 ; Cai et al. 2017 ). On the 951 other hand, inorganic electrospun membranes, made of silica nanotubes or 952 Hematite, were developed (Nalbandian et al. 2016 ; Wang et al. 2015 ). No 953 requirement of modi ﬁcation, both natural membrane absorbents had strong 954 adsorption capacity of heavy metals, and higher mechanical strength and chemical 955 resistance than their polymer counterparts. 95620.4 Summary and Future Prospects 957 The use of nano ﬁbers for water and wastewater treatment is gaining fast ground for 958 promising future use. This is primarily due to the many interesting and controllable 959 properties and functionalities that can be designed for nano ﬁber membranes. The 960 surge in nano ﬁber-related research for desalination, water, and wastewater treat- 961 ment in the last decade provides evidence of its wide interest in various ﬁelds, may 962 it be academe or industry. However, there are still a number of challenges that Fig. 20.12 Desorption percentages of Fe(III), Cu(II),and Cd(II) ions upon regeneration of electrospun AOPAN/RC blend nano ﬁber membranes for 1 –5 cycles (Feng et al. 2018 )458 L.

One of the biggest challenges that many are always curious 965 about is the upscaling potential of the nano ﬁber fabrication. Though many new 966 equipment have sprung providing glimpse of mass production potential, still if 967 further modi ﬁcations are needed after electrospinning, this could pose additional 968 challenge. However, the future of electrospun membranes seems to be bright as 969 advances in nanotechnologies in terms of precision and ef ﬁciency are making the 970 electrospinning technique more viable with ease of operation. Also, newer nano- 971 materials and innovative surface modi ﬁcation methods are being realized, hence 972 making it more attractive to apply to nano ﬁbers with high surface area and porous 973 structure that are essential for ef ﬁcient membrane ﬁltration process. 974References 975 Ahmed FE, Lalia BS, Hashaikeh R (2015) A review on electrospinning for membrane fabrication: 976 challenges and applications.
